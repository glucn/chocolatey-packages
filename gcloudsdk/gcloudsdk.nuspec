    <description><![CDATA[# Google Cloud CLI

## What is the gcloud CLI?

The Google Cloud CLI is a set of tools to create and manage Google Cloud resources. You can use these tools to perform many common platform tasks from the command line or through scripts and other automation.

For example, you can use the gcloud CLI to create and manage the following:

    - Compute Engine virtual machine instances and other resources
    - Cloud SQL instances
    - Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
    - Dataproc clusters and jobs
    - Cloud DNS managed zones and record sets
    - Cloud Deployment Manager deployments

You can also use the gcloud CLI to deploy App Engine applications, manage authentication, customize local configuration, and perform other tasks.

## The gcloud CLI cheat sheet

For a quick introduction to the gcloud CLI, a list of commonly used commands, and a look at how these commands are structured, see the [gcloud CLI cheat sheet](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet).

## Configurations

A configuration is a set of gcloud CLI properties. A configuration works like a `profile`.

When you start using the gcloud CLI, you'll work with a single configuration named `default` and you can set properties by running `gcloud init` or `gcloud config set`. This single default configuration is suitable for most use cases.

To work with multiple projects or authorization accounts, you can set up multiple configurations with `gcloud config configurations create` and switch among the configurations. Within a configuration, you can customize properties. For example, to set your project within an active configuration use the `project` property:

```
gcloud config set project project-id
```

For a detailed account of these concepts, see the [Configurations guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations).
